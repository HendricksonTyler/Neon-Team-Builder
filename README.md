# Neon Team Builder
Neon Team Builder is a project I worked on while learning C# my senior year of high school. I developed this program as a tool for the competitive Pokémon community. Neon Team Builder analyzes a team of six Pokémon and gives a visual representation of that team's type advantages and weaknesses. This helps players construct a more balanced team.

## Download
**NOTE**: This program can only be run on the Windows operating system.

In order to use this program, please visit [this link](http://tylerhendrickson.me/downloads/NeonTeamBuilder.zip) to download an executable that can be run on your local machine. Rest assured, this is just a simple Windows form app and will not harm your computer in any way. Once downloaded, unzip the folder. Inside, there will be two items: an executable and a "Resources" folder. **Do not remove either of these from this folder** as the program will not load correctly.

## How to Use
Neon Team Builder should be pretty easy to figure out once you play around with it a bit. You can choose and modify the Pokémon on your team by using the controls in the *Team* box. Each time a value is changed, the *Type Matchup* table, *Competitive Battling* table, and *Stat Totals* table will all update automatically. In the *Type Matchup* table, your weaknesses will show as red and your resistances will show as green. The brighter the color, the stronger the weakness/resistance. Use this to identify any severe imbalances of your Pokémon team.
